This repository contains code for a project that leveraged experimental and synthetic/simulated data to explore the use of two dimensional resonant Raman spectroscopy. The code is provided in two versions: MATLAB and Python.

## Folder Structure
### matlab:
This folder contains the original MATLAB files for the project.
### python:
This folder contains the converted Python files for the project.

## Dependencies
### MATLAB:
MATLAB 2016

### Python:


## Usage
### MATLAB & Python:
M

## Converting Between MATLAB and Python
The Python code in the python folder was converted from the original MATLAB code in the matlab folder.
The conversion process involved selecting pythonic substitutes for MATLAB built-in functions.
